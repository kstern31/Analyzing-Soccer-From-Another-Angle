# Analyzing-Soccer-From-Another-Angle

1. example.mp4 is one of the clips that was mainly used for this analysis.

2. Condensed version of the analysis is done in the video-analysis notebook. If you would like to know other techniques
that I tried to use, feel free to send me a message! 

3. Majority of the tracking/mapping is done using OpenCV, with the projective transform done in skimage.

4. transition-slow.mp4 shows the process in action.

5. sidebyside.mov shows the mapping for this particular video clip.
